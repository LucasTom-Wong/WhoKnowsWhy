Seems I don't know quite enough of how databases work.
I wonder what a non-relational database is....

This video seems to be mainly focused on data management and how to store data.
--> goes over different methods of storing
--> linking seems important

Linking vs Embedding
-- hmm... not quite sure I understand

Design Patterns -->
--> Talked about before, interesting how data is stored, I should take notes.
-->--> Each data has like name, and then also has like subnames which all store.. --> like an array

SCHEMA. idk what this is

Defining data model is something that I can do and something I should actively think about.
--> I thought sql has this

Relationships
--> what is relational and non-relational databases?
-->--> I don't quite know the differences.


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaa
- need to learn more
