-- app.py -- noticed --

disp_loginpage is the main function/route
will print stuff
uses request (from flask)
request might not work because we dont have a request
no request to the template
authenticate seems redundant, like how would you use it

-- app.py -- stuff --

stuff printed to terminal
returns template
get asks for information
 - the request being made
After submitting, it goes to authenticate


-- login.html -- noticed --
input type text
input type submit
should pass on information

-- login.html -- stuff --

stuff printed to terminal
returns "Waaa hoo HAAAH" on webpage
<form action="/auth"> -> redirets to /auth with information in url
