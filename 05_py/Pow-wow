Names assignment.
Combined two programs.

names.py will take two text files as arguments.
Each file will represent one period.
Then you will be asked to put an input of 1, 2, or 3.
If you input 1, you will get a random name from period 1.
If you input 2, you will get a random name from period 2.
If you input 3, you will get a random name from a list containing both periods.
