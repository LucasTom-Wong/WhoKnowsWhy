Lots of javascript stuff
  - However javascript wasn't needed and the html file still loaded without the javascript code

Medium and Large refers to the size of the device screen. So a cell phone and a monitor would be different sizes.
  - Changing the size of the window doesn't affect this.
  - When a number is associates with small, medium, or large, it impacts the number of elements per line for a device with that screen size
  - In order to keep important elements legible, one should use larger numbers (less elements per line) with a smaller device

Cells are the measurement of size of a element
  - More cells -> more width???/length

Multiple classes can coexist

Div (dividers?) are really useful and important

Labels will place text on top of the element.... labelling it

Classes can get overwritten with other newer classes if they don't interact well.

QCC
Can each element have multiple classes?
What do cells mean?

Q0
