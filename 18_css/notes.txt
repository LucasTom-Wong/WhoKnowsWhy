Inline:
Declares stylization that will affect only a single html element.

Internal
A spreadsheet but already inside the html file. Therefore you don't need to link the css file to the html file.

External:
Uses an external css file in order to import stylizations. Apparently this is extremely common. This also allows for standardized styling. Requires link to the css spreadsheet in the html file.

List style for lists

Padding removes indents
