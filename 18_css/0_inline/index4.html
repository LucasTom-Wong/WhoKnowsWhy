        <p>Try a more powerful colour we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun can you use a high definition screenshot. I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer it's great, can you add a beard though yet I really think this could go viral, for can you punch up the fun level on these icons can you make it more infographic-y can we make it shorter? or is this the best we can do. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch.

Pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch but there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time can we have another option.

That's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer. Try making it a bit less blah theres all this spanish text on my site. I'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand it needs to be the same, but totally different can we try some other colours maybe, or can my website be in english?. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy we try your eye, but can you change everything? we have big contacts we will promote you, or needs to be sleeker. Make it sexy thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix. It looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger. Can we have another option thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix, the flier should feel like a warm handshake, for I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, yet low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. Can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front is this the best we can do, but we don't need a contract, do we. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version you can get my logo from facebook can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere this turned out different that i decscribed yet we don't need a backup, it never goes down!.
