    <p>Try a more powerful colour we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun can you use a high definition screenshot. I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer it's great, can you add a beard though yet I really think this could go viral, for can you punch up the fun level on these icons can you make it more infographic-y can we make it shorter? or is this the best we can do. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman?
