Copy paste the following as a link in order to use:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">

Has a lot of things that are unused. Very big file. Takes time to load. Found at: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/contents/

Contains prebuilt/predefined content that is usable by pasting in code.

class="typeofcontentmakesureitisastring"

Seems really useful if the style you need work

Dropdown and collapse require javascript?

Bootstrap is used when you want to put in minimal amount of work.

A CDN is a content delivery network. In the case of this HTML file, we are using jsdelivr (free for open source).
This CDN is providing all of the CSS associated with bootstrap. By clicking the the associated with the bootstrap CSS comment,
we can view all of that CSS.

Different classes already have different formatting attached.

An html element can be given multiple classes by seperating them with a space within the same quotations.
(i.e. <a class="class0 class1"></a>)
Each class has some unique CSS assosciated with it such that any element given that class has a specific feature.
For example, for different flex layouts there are classes that determine how elements are spaced (which correspond to different CSS options for justify-content)
By assigning an element different classes, it gets different CSS formatting.

There are quite a few things that don't work without JavaScript. Specifically animated objects. Such as dropdown menu.

Flex? -> quickly able to change stuff, custom css but you are adapting already prebuilt functions: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/flex/
