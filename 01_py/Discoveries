Thanks to the other members of team Blind Elmo: Zhao, Chris, Lewis Clark.

I haven't reviewed snake in a long time so a lot of this stuff was confusing at first.

Line 9: "from random import randrange" was confusing to me as I didn't understand why not just import random.
The reason for this is to import less stuff since only randrange was being used.
The entire module of random is not needed.

I didn't know what module sys was but my group members told me that sys:
is related to functions involving the system (computar) including the terminal.

If strings are not empty, they are equal to true.
Line 20: "names = [name for name in names if name]"

I didn't understand why we needed a main function.
Having a main function ensures that when you call a function in the program, it doesn't run it.
If you were to not have a main function, everytime you call something from the program,
it would run the program.
Lines 38-39:
"if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()"

That is all. It also helped review stuff I haven't seen in 3+ years.
