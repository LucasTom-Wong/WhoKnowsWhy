K14 -- Form and Function -- Utilizing Request Info
2021-10-15

Summary:
We explored requests and forms. We figured out the infoflow for HTML, and how to access valuable information through Flask.
In the case of Flask, the request object contains a lot of useful information, like User-Agent, to the request type.
In this case, we explored the transfer of info through the username, an object we tagged onto the request through form.

Results of going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP&sub1=Submit:
***DIAG: this Flask obj ***
<Flask 'app'>
***DIAG: request obj ***
<Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP&sub1=Submit' [GET]>
***DIAG: request.args ***
ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP'), ('sub1', 'Submit')])
***DIAG: request.headers ***

Questions:
What would  other reqs (like POST) look like? I don't expect too much but just wondering if it follows this same pattern.
Is there a cleaner way to sort through all this info or is it busywork that we will have to get used to?

Comments:
Every website appears to have a request object of some sort, and will at the very least be a GET req that retrieves the website info
from the server. Furthermore, one accesses this in Flask through the request object.

trioTASK:
~~~~~~~~~~~ BEFORE RUNNING THIS, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...read for understanding all of the code below.
Some will work as written; other sections will not. Can you predict which?
Devise some simple tests you can run to "take apart this engine," as it were.
Execute your tests. Process results.
PROTIP: Insert your own in-line comments wherever they will help your future self and/or current teammates understand what is going on.
