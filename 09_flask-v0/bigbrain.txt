K<09> -- <Simple Path to Greatness/Something to do with flask>
<2021>-<10>-<03>

line 1: imports the function flask from the module flask (flask.flask)
line 2: app? not sure what this does but it uses the flask function or something from the module flask as well as the program from (__name__)
line 4: no clue
line 5: denotes function hello_world
line 6: prints the name of the program, ie: app.py or app or something like that
line 7: returns "No hablo queso!" after running function
line 9: runs the app??

based on this i can assume that line 9 runs app
app is Flask(__name__) probably meaning that it runs the program

from a python website
https://pythonbasics.org/flask-tutorial-routes/
@app.route('/') is a route
therefore i would assume @app.route("/") is the same
app.route is used with flask as well as app = Flask(__name__)

in order to run the program you need to install the Program

cd into the proper directory
create a virtual environment
activate the environment
then install flask with pip install Flask

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/

i believe this will just run the file as if it didnt use flask, but with using Flask
basically it will call itself to run
but im not sure if it will do anything because hello_world isnt called
not sure what app.route does still
but im assuming that when you do app.run(), it runs the program because
app = Flask(__name__) was called earlier which i believe it is similar to
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
and the main function
