Sqlite is a relational database

Sqlite has terminal operations
  - starts with a period (.)
  - ends with semicolon (;)

Can be executed within python code by using db.execute("SQLITE STUFF")

Inside of python text editor
Need to import sqlite3

sqlite3.connect("File_Name")
  - Opens a database file with this File_Name
    - If it doesn't exist, then it will create a file with the name File_Name

db <- the database itself, the file which was created or opened with sqlite3.connect()

c = db.cursor() <- specifies where future programs will be run as a variable

c.execute(THINGY you want to do)

Self explanatory... similar to git.commit and git.push (changes/git.add were already made)
b.commit() #save changes
db.close()


IF NOT EXISTS is useful
