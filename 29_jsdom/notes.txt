Id in document.getElementById is Id -> keep track of capital and lowercase

id of object in html is defined by id you set

button.addEventListener("click", function(){
  display(gcd(15, 20));
});
--listens to click, then does function() which is defined below it

grab element (textbox) and then grab its value attribute

function(){} can be replaced with function_name

that function_name should not have parameters probably
